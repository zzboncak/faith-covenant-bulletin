  Inside the lie of inward shame
  But fix our eyes upon the cross

  Come and rise up from the grave

  Beneath the weight of all our sin
  You bowed to none but heaven's will
  No scheme of hell no scoffer's crown
  No burden great can hold You down

  In strength You reign
  Forever let Your church proclaim

  Christ is risen from the dead
  Trampling over death by death
  Come awake, come awake
  Come and rise up from the grave
  Christ is risen from the dead
  We are one with Him again
  Come awake, come awake
  Come and rise up from the grave

  O death where is your sting
  O hell where is your victory
  O church come stand in the light
  The glory of God has defeated the night
  Singing O death where is your sting
  O hell where is your victory
  O church come stand in the light
  Our God is not dead He's alive He's alive!

  Christ is risen from the dead
  Trampling over death by death
  Come awake, come awake
  Come and rise up from the grave
  Christ is risen from the dead
  We are one with Him again
  Come awake, come awake
  Come and rise up from the grave`

  The stone was rolled away
  His perfect love could not be overcome
  Now death where is your sting
  Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

  Forever He is lifted high
  And forever He is risen
  He is alive and He is alive

  We sing hallelujah the Lamb has overcome

  We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah

  endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won.`

  content: `Now let us from this table rise 
  Renewed in body mind and soul 
  With Christ we die and live again 
  His selfless love has made us whole

  With minds alert upheld by grace
  To spread the Word in speech and deed 
  We follow in the steps of Christ
  At one with man in hope and need

  To fill each human house with love 
  It is the sacrament of care
  The work that Christ began to do 
  We humbly pledge ourselves to share

  Then grant us courage Father God 
  To choose again the pilgrim way 
  And help us to accept with joy 
  The challenge of tomorrow's day`
